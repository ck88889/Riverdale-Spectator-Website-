  <p class="first_paragraph">
   For our second Humans of Riverdale piece, we’re showcasing our new principal, Mr. Au. We decided to interview him so that we Riverdalians could get to know him a little bit better!
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Mr. Au began teaching at Monarch Park Collegiate Institute in 2000. He started out as a science (primarily biology) teacher, but after a few years at Monarch, he also started teaching guitar for their music program.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Our new principal is settling in nicely. He says he enjoys the school community, including the welcoming and pleasant students, lovely staff, great caretakers, and beautiful building.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Mr. Au’s favourite subject in school was “always music, and that’s what [he] really focused on when [he] was young.” He explains, “Music was a really important part of my identity; it was what I was passionate about, playing music and meeting people through music.” Mr. Au loves music so much that he was in a rock band in high school. “The name was ever-changing. I think we went through four in the span of a couple months. I had long black hair that came down to my shoulders; really rocker-esque.” He also loves the sciences; he was inspired to go into biology and education by his biology teacher, Mr. Goodman.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   He was a part of every music-related club in high school, from Combo jazz to big band to the pit band when his school did the musical Hair. He has never failed a class but came close in high-school French class and second-year-university organic chemistry.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   During a speed round of questions, we learned that Mr. Au is a smooth, all-natural peanut butter kind of guy, he’s always the race car when he plays monopoly (“it’s not even a question”), his favourite movie is Streets of Fire, his favourite book is Cooked by Michael Pollan, his favourite snack is potato chips, his superpower of choice would be mind control, and finally, “[he] would have been a rock star” had he not been a teacher.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   We asked Mr. Au what he wants RCI to know about him, and he said that he’s open to meeting with anyone to discuss any concerns. He also wants RCI to know that he’s extremely happy to be here. “When I asked for a transfer, it was for a larger school because I was [last] principal at a very small special needs school. Don’t get me wrong, it was wonderful, but I’d been there for a few years and was looking for a change. I asked for something completely different.”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   When we asked our new principal what he’s interested to learn about Riverdale, he simply replied, “the people.” He wants to learn about Riverdalians and their stories. "This year at my old school, there were only 109 students enrolled (and about twenty-seven were virtual). So there were less than 100 students in the building. Wonderful students, but very high needs. It was amazing to see how people can communicate, even if they're non-verbal. So many of my students wouldn't speak, but they could communicate through drawing, through sign language, through gesturing, and through touching your hands and stuff like that. And that was a wonderful experience, getting to know different people and their stories.”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Finally, we asked him our most requested question: how do you pronounce Mr. Au?
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “I was always told by my parents: if I step on your foot, it’s the sound you make. ‘Ow!’ Sometimes people call me Mr. Gold, element 79, that’s always popular with the science students.”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Welcome to Riverdale, Mr. Au!
