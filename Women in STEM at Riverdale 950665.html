  <p class="first_paragraph">
   Roadblocks for women in STEM are present today more than ever, and sometimes a lot closer to us than we think. Even right here at Riverdale, women in STEM face challenges day to day. With continual discouragement, lack of female role models, negative peer pressure, and lesser chances of leadership roles, female students are less inclined to pursue STEM at Riverdale and in post-secondary institutions.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Take RCI's robotics team for an example. In an interview with two female students on the team (who would like to remain anonymous), we get new perspectives on life as a female Robotics member. One of the biggest issues for women in STEM is a lack of female role models. On this topic, the first student says "I've been on the team for 2 years and last year there were a lot of senior girls who were encouraging and positive. It helped to have these older role models and senior female students who were on the team with me." Having female role models is crucial in the development of confidence in young women, they represent and expand what is possible, as well as inspire women to be more ambitious and aim higher. Having positive female role models in the STEM field demonstrate the mindsets and behaviors on how to grow. To pave the way for junior female students, senior female students have grown into leadership roles. The second student added to that, saying, "I remember being a grade 9 student looking up to the older girls and that is why it's so important for older grades to be cognisant that we are role models for the younger girls." The second student goes on to say that it's sometimes difficult finding strong female leaders to look up to when they aren't really given any, she says, "in robotics there are mentors, sometimes older students, individuals from STEM fields or teachers who help and guide the younger students. Most of the mentors are typically men which can be a bit upsetting as a girl."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Young women in STEM face continual discouragement day to day, the first student says "Being a girl on the Robotics team as opposed to being a guy is very different. That isn't to say it isn't worth it however, with some aspects of Robotics being a female student can be a bit of a setback. Even in small discreet ways girls are treated differently in STEM. Even some of the staff treat us differently, it can be discouraging. A lot of manual labor tasks are given to the boys and it's almost as if the girls are invisible." Discouragement comes both inside and outside the classroom, as the first student says, "When I'm doing a lab, sometimes male students will get impatient and tell me to get out of the way or do my task for me, it can be really discouraging and doesn't always come off playfully." While there isn't a huge imbalance between the female and male students on the Robotics team the first student says, "I think there are a few more boys on the team mostly because engineering is a male-dominated field and so is programming/building/construction. I think there were a few girls on the programming team last year but it's generally all boys. It could be a fear factor, as a girl, it's intimidating joining the programming team seeing it be all boys, I'd be scared of judgment. Seeing how women are treated in STEM fields in the real world it's intimidating to join an all-boys team."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Despite the struggles female students face in the STEM field specifically Robotics they don't come without reward as the second student says, "it's not only a great team but also an amazing group of friends. You learn a lot on the team that you wouldn't always have the opportunity to learn outside of the Robotics club. It's also an amazing opportunity and experience for anyone interested specifically in engineering. Even those who aren't interested in engineering can still learn about building, programming and coding as well as being on the business side of things. All in all, Robotics is an incredible opportunity for all RCI students."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Even with all the setbacks female STEM students face on a daily basis, most senior female Robotics students would agree with both students interviewed, "it's one of the most important communities we are in since it is one of our best memories connected to the STEM field and school especially because Covid cut off so many experiences. A lot of our Robotics experiences were some of the most important, and while we think that there are still setbacks, it doesn't mean you shouldn't try and push past them."
