   THE RED NOTICE ★★
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   When Red Notice came out,  I won’t lie; I was excited. An all-star cast, a huge budget. Should be a fun time.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Turns out money can’t buy happiness or ideas because Red Notice feels like Indiana Jones remastered for YouTube Kids. Starring Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot, and Dwayne “The Rock" Johnson, it follows the story of three rival thieves who swindle and betray each other in an effort to get their hands on Cleopatra’s three sacred golden eggs. And here’s my first issue: none of the actors act like thieves. They play themselves rather than their characters. Except, of course, for Ryan Reynolds, who has already proven himself a bonafide thief by stealing our hearts on numerous occasions. He is the only saving grace of this film, keeping it afloat with his effortless comedy. Honestly, it feels like he’s the only one trying. Dwayne doesn’t seem into it at all, while Gadot doesn’t appear to know who she is playing, her accent changing several times during the 117-minute runtime.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Is Red Notice a good movie? No. But is it a nice thing to play in the background, of which you can catch a few minutes and go on with your day? Also no. The only good to come of this flick is prime Ryan Reynolds, who shows off how much better he can make an otherwise atrocious movie. Someone needs to get Ryan some better projects.
  </p>
  <p class="article font-bold">
   THE FRENCH DISPATCH ★★★★1/2
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Wes Anderson’s tenth film, The French Dispatch,    is    a    beautiful    anthology about the final copy of the Parisian newspaper, The French Dispatch. If you thought Red Notice had a stacked cast, look again. In classic Wes Anderson fashion, all of your older cousin’s favorite actors are in this movie. From Timothee Chalamet to Bill Murray, there are convincing performances across the board. In just under two hours, the film tells four stories that highlight the most popular columns of the decade: a radical artist sentenced to life in prison, student riots, a kidnapping resolved by a chef, and a simple tour through a fictional city. Each as beautifully decorated and stylized as the last. If you’re a fan of lavish set designs, attention to minute detail, or just France itself, this is the film for you.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   The French Dispatch is completely unlike anything out right now (and it knows it). This film isn’t just trying to make money or attract packed theatres but exists purely to exist, as most Wes Anderson movies do. And speaking of Wes Anderson, the visionary behind The French Dispatch, his unique style is in full force; everything he has experimented in for the past 20 years is thrown into a massive mixing pot and stirred to perfection. The stop motion, the posh hilarity, the ensemble cast; everything this man is capable of producing is in this movie, and I love it.
  </p>
  <p class="article font-bold">
   DO THE RIGHT THING ★★★★★
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   It’s reported to be the hottest day of the year, and tensions rise along with the temperature. Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing is a perfect movie. Not to say it’s flawless, but no one could have made it better than Spike did. The whole film takes place on the hottest day of the year.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   It’s set to be a normal day for Sal Fragione’s pizzeria until one of his customers starts making a ruckus about Sal's “Wall of Fame” only exhibiting Italian actors when the pizzeria is in a majority-black neighbourhood. It seems like a simple fix, but tensions rise fast when neither side budges on a resolution. Sides are taken. Boycotts are arranged. It’s not pretty. Caught in the middle of it all is pizza delivery man, Mookie, who tries to make sense of the situation and decide where his loyalties lie.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Do the Right Thing is one of those films where it could just be the characters going about their daily lives and you would still be content as the viewer. Spike portrays everyday life so vibrantly that real life dulls in comparison. But that isn’t even what makes the movie in my eyes. It’s the characters. Every side character, no matter how minor, plays an important role. Many of them are so outlandish and genuine that they must be based on real people. You can’t make individuals like this up! Really, any of them could have been the main character. The entire film is a masterclass in expectation subversion, holding audiences’ interest, and making an innocent yet thought-provoking issue into a boiling pot with nearly every social issue known to man.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Unfortunately, what happens in Do the Right Thing is almost too real. Though it was made thirty years ago, the issues it explores are even more relevant now than when the movie came out. Many of Spike’s films grapple with the black experience but Do the Right Thing takes the cake. With the Black Lives Matter movement being in full effect, Do the Right Thing is more than an amazing watch. It is also a means to educate and inform on just how high the stakes are.
