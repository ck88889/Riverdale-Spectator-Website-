  <p class="first_paragraph">
   One  dull  evening,  Prince  Kyi  was inside the castle, in his room as a punishment for daringly filling one of the royal   servant’s   shoes   with thumbtacks. As the only child of the Great King Svelvin and Majestic Queen Yawinn, he was often up to no good; planting pranks and getting into huge amounts of trouble.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “I’m. So. Bored!” groaned Kyi, dangling upside down from his bunk bed. “Don’t you wanna get outta here and do something fun? I’d rather clean dragon poop in the stables than be here.”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “No, Kyi, remember what Master said? ‘You cannot go anywhere because—’”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “‘I’m grounded for life until I can learn to act like a proper prince!’” mocked Kyi, in his best impression of his father. “I know, Boshi the Dorsegoat, you don’t have to remind me.”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Boshi was Kyi’s pet and companion. The name ‘Dorsegoat’ alluded to the fact that Boshi was part goat, part dog, and part horse-- a very rare creature to encounter nowadays.   The two had been best friends since the day they met in Elgerwicker Woods.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   When Kyi stumbled upon such a peculiar creature with baby blue splotches all over its silver body, a long mane that flickered like fiery flames, and eyes of polished emerald, he could not just leave it be. He could not forget about the creature. So instead, they became a team. Boshi was the loyal one with an obedient spirit, while Kyi was… let’s just say he was the rascal of the duo.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Kyi was struck by an idea. And as you can imagine, it was a pretty naughty one.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “Boshi, what if we just stepped outside  for a bit to explore the castle garden?”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “Oh, here we go again,” sighed Boshi.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “No, listen, it’s the perfect plan! That way, we’ll be right outside my room and won’t be bored anymore!”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “As your BFF, I can’t stop you, but I will tell you that that’s a bad idea!”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Kyi frowned and put his hands on his hips. “Well, if you’re not gonna come with me, that’s fine. I’ll go enjoy those delicious,   crispy   Ghilji  leaves  all  bymyself,” he teased, knowing that the leaves were Boshi’s favourite food.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “You wouldn’t!” Boshi gasped.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “Oh yes, I would!” Kyi ran towards his room’s star-shaped window, swiftly pushed it open, and jumped straight out, head first.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Boshi was appalled, his lips wide open, forming a perfect ‘O’. He rushed towards the ledge, a feeling of absolute dread in his stomach— only to find Kyi howling in laughter on top of a large bush.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “Kyi, are you okay?!” screeched Boshi from above. Kyi gave him a thumbs-up. With a quick jerk of Boshi’s small, triangular ears, some of the castle bricks wiggled and jiggled outwards, creating a spiral set of stairs for him to walk down. When he landed, the bricks returned to their natural places.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “You could’ve done that this whole time? Now my robes are all dirty.”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “Not the point! Don’t you ever jump out a window like that again!”
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “I can’t guarantee nothing,” chuckled Kyi, getting up and dusting himself off.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “I’m just glad you’re not hurt. Now, since I’m already down here, those Ghilji leaves aren’t going to eat themselves, are they?” They grinned at each other.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   The palace garden was a remarkable sight; fields of fresh, forest-green grass sprouted wildly, housing the most magnificent flowers you could imagine. Snow-white calla lilies, spotted ghost orchids, sunset-coloured lady slippers, and the occasional old man of the forest mushroom. Twinkling fireflies illuminated the cobblestone pathways, all humming an ancient song the gardeners claimed could help the flowers grow. In the distance were coral-coloured trees with large pearl orbs hanging from each branch, standing tall under the symphony of purple that was the sky.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “Wow… I wish Father would let me outta the castle more often,” Kyi murmured in awe.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   “Technically, he didn’t let you out,” remarked Boshi. Kyi scoffed.
  </p>
