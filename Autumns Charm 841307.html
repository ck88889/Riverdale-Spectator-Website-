  <p class="first_paragraph">
   The autumn leaves whirled A. around, whistling with the wind. The park was serene. Kids playing, adults laughing, and birds chirping. The autumn leaves were the cherry on top, painting the scene with the colours of a flickering fire. Although it signified the end of a warm season, the beauty the people got to see made up for the cold days ahead. Had the scene been painted, the artist surely would've noticed the warm centre of it all. A boy in grey, nervously chatting away with the girl laughing in the yellow raincoat.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   To a stranger, Levi was a quiet, somewhat dull boy, who was the personification of grey. To his friends, Levi was shy, yet rich in personality. He was eccentric, smart, and funny, but simply too introverted to make a presence. To Amelia, he was perfect. The two fifteen-year-olds met at the beginning of high school, yet from their very first conversation, they immediately knew they had clicked. Although Amelia was more sociable, both of them appreciated quiet. Amelia's willingness to dive into a conversation allowed a wonderful friendship to blossom, until they realised they wanted to be more than just friends. Just a month into their friendship, they both embraced their mutual feelings, and they started dating. Levi awkwardly shuffled his feet across the foliage. Surveying the lively park, the sight of the familiar yellow raincoat caught his attention. Levi waved towards the figure, who hurried over at the sight of him.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Hey! Why'd you call me here?" the girl puffed, slightly shaken from the run.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "N-nothing," Levi stammered. "Just wanted your company, Amelia."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Amelia cheekily grinned, "Two days and you already miss me?"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Levi avoided her gaze, "I guess."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   He sat down by the foot of a tree, where Amelia followed suit. The two sat close to one another in blissful silence for some time, appreciating each other's warmth in the cooling weather. Levi was so relaxed that he nearly jolted at the sudden weight that had fallen on his shoulder. He carefully turned to his right and saw that Amelia had fallen asleep. Levi smiled to himself. No matter how much time passed, part of him still couldn't believe they were actually dating. Levi gently snaked his arm around Amelia's shoulder and pulled her close. Levi was the happiest he had been all week, but even so, a small frown ruptured his gentle expression as a sense of guilt suddenly washed over him. The two of them were under this exact tree only a few weeks ago. It had been a beautiful day and just like today, Levi had singled out the big tree in the park as a nice spot for him and Amelia. The two had sat in silence. Only the wind was audible, the rest of the world was quiet. To the new couple, it was only the two  of them in the entire world.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "You know," Amelia had begun, giving him a meaningful look. "This is a spot where a lot of couples have shared their first kiss."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   On the outside, Levi merely nodded. On the inside, he was freaking out. Of course, couples kiss under the beautiful hollywood-esque tree, just like in a fairytale. Time seemed to slow down, as Amelia slowly leaned forward.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   What am I supposed to do? Do I want to kiss her? Yes, I do, but I'm so nervous. What should I do? It'd be so awkward if I pulled away, and it's not like I don't want to, but I'm... just not ready.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Levi?" Amelia's voice cut through the mess of anxiety that was Levi's current state of mind.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Y-yes?"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Amelia looked down, her hair hiding her expression. "It's alright, I'll wait until you're ready."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Part of him felt happy that Amelia respected Levi's personal space, and that she cared enough about him to. On the other hand, Levi felt that he wasn't showing that he cared enough about her.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "What kind of partner can't kiss the person they love?" Levi murmured to himself, shaking his head.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   The once-calm wind began to pick up speed. The whistling transformed into wailing. Levi looked over at Amelia - still asleep. It must be cold for her, Levi thought. I'd hate for her to get a cold. Levi slid closer to Amelia, both arms around her. He awkwardly sat there, arms around his sleeping partner.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "I should've thought of what to do next because hugging her is doing nothing right now," Levi muttered to himself.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Maybe if I-" "You're not doing nothing." Levi blinked, surprised.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "You're awake?"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   She smiled. "Never asleep."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   He grimaced processing all the things he did and mumbled. "Hey, did you hear me-"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Yes." Amelia turned her head to face Levi, her expression flickering from playful to concerned.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Are you forcing yourself to hug me right now?" Levi felt Amelia stiffen around his arms. In response, he hugged her a little tighter.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "No, I'm hugging you because I want to." With those words, he felt her relax in his embrace.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "If that's the case, then that's all you have to do." Amelia said.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "What keeps making you feel bad?"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Levi's immediate reaction was to deny any problems, but then Amelia's question sunk in. What am I afraid of? I'm not afraid of her, that's definitely not it. I... Before Levi began suffocating in his mind, Amelia tapped him on the shoulder, shaking him from his trance.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Just talk to me about what you're feeling, I don't care if it's a jumbled mess, I just want to hear it" Levi began to wrack his brain.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "You know like when there's that fluttering feeling?" He looked at her, slightly fearful that she would think he was insane. Amelia merely nodded encouragingly.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "S-so it's like, not really fear but it's kind of jittery? A-And it makes me feel stiff. but I shouldn't feel this way, right? It feels like I'm doing something wrong..."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Levi's voice trailed oft avoiding her gaze. After a few awkward seconds, he risked a glance at his partner. Amelia smirked, clearly knowing far more about Levi than he knew about himself.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "You're just nervous. There's nothing more complicated than that."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "I-I know!" Levi blurted, surprising Amelia.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "It's just... surely that can't be it? I'm not supposed to be nervous around you!"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   She smiled warmly. "Levi... it's perfectly normal."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   He sighed, he knew that as well. "I just don't want to be nervous around you anymore."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Amelia gestured to Levi's arms which were still wrapped around her. "You're already doing pretty well in my opinion."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   The sun that once shone a bright yellow began to shine a pungent orange, with the sky following suit. The wind was calm once more. helping paint the sky with more colours of the leaves. The two sat in comfortable silence, admiring the scenery. The sleepy children whined to their parents. the birds chirped quieter, and the sun began to sink. Soon, it was just the two of them, basking in the comfortable moonlight. Amelia abruptly stood up, knocking Levi over.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "Sorry!" Amelia giggled, helping him up.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Levi smiled, "As if you feel bad."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Amelia grinned in return. "You know me so well."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   The two walked in tandem, heading to their respective homes. "Hey,- Amelia whispered. Levi turned towards her.
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   "What's up?" "If all that was about that almost kiss - when I told you I'll wait until you're ready, I meant it"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Levi blushed before grabbing Amelia's hand. "Thank you."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   He looked down, hiding his smile. "Guess I better get ready too,"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Amelia declared and gently nudged him. "I'm hoping you mean that test because your grades need work,"
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   Levi scoffed. "Harsh."
  </p>
  <p class="article">
   The two laughed, filling the quiet park. Even as they quieted down, their happiness didn't falter. They both knew that autumn would give them more moments like this, for many years to come. At last, with the birds asleep, kids tucked into bed, and the moon hiding away the fiery colours with its cold light, the wind finally fell asleep, leaving the two lovers to their own devices, ready to start again the next day. Autumn is a charming season. It shows its flair by burning its trees with bright colours, while making music with its winds. Bringing people together with its music and fiery colours is what makes autumn such a charming season. Autumn doesn't discriminate, it'll bring everyone together with enough time. So, the two lovers needn't worry, for nobody can resist autumn's charm.
