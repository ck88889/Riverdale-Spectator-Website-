    Are you a holiday lover? Do you feel the need to fill your brain with useless knowledge? Are you in desperate need of something to look forward to? Well, weird holidays can help! This list of upcoming days has been carefully curated to make you question what these people were thinking.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    1) If you're into irony, dad humor, or somehow like Mondays, then January 2nd is perfect for you! This day has been deemed National Thank God It's Monday day. Now I don't know who woke up and felt the strange feeling of being overjoyed because Monday really did make its weekly appearance, but nevertheless, we should all find ourselves saying: Thank god it's Monday!
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    2) If I don't see anyone in full Victorian glam this December 8th, I'll be quite miffed to say the least. For it is National Pretend to be a Time Traveler Day. This day is perfect if you've been itching to pull out your hyper realistic historically accurate outfits and speak like Shakespeare. But it's not just a day for the past, I, for one, intend to take full advantage and act like I'm from the future. Use your improv skills, This above all; to thine own self be true. - William Shakespeare.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    3) Calling all elevator users, this July 29th is National Talk In An Elevator Day. If you're a fan of good old-fashioned awkward small talk then start counting down. I, along with other introverts and anti-social individuals, will be boosting my step count by choosing the stairs. Don't you just love being active? If you are planning to face the dangers of the elevator despite the tiny voice telling you to turn back, large headphones paired with loud music might just spare the rest of your social battery.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    4) Get your picnic blankets ready because June 8th is National Picnic Day. In theory, this day will be full of happiness, laughter, and mini food items. However, this day has also been named National Panic Day. I can tell you that my day will start nicely, with a nice picnic with mini sandwiches and pastries, and end with me crying in a fit of rage. Now I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty nice to me.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    5) I better be seeing all of you listening to your favourite one-hit wonders on September 25th, because ifs- you guessed it-National One-Hit Wonder Day! You can catch me listening to Stacy Q any day of the week, but it's her time to shine on the 25th. If you're having trouble remembering some songs, I'll list a few. Tainted love, Rock me Amadeus, Ice ice baby, and of course, two of hearts. Take this opportunity to discover great talent that was never heard after their hit song.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    6) This last date goes out to all my Charlie's; April 6 is National Sorry Charlie day. The creator of this day was almost certainly a self-centered Charlie throwing themself a pity party. However, there might be some science behind it; are we all disproportionately disrespecting Charlie's worldwide? Whatever the reason for the day, find a Charlie and say sorry. I hope this list satisfies your every want and need.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Cheers, Priya
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Ater  years  of   rising  tensions   and months of Russian presence on the Ukrainian border, on February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a devastating assault on Ukraine. The ensuing weeks have seen thousands of Ukrainian civilians displaced and numerous communities suffering from food, medicine, and clean water shortages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Until April 2nd, Riverdale Robotics will be collecting donations to support Ukraine during this humanitarian crisis. Every two dollars will represent an origami paper crane,  which  will hang in the atrium as a symbol of hope and unity. All donations will go towards UNICEF's humanitarian response activities in Ukraine.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    If you would like to contribute, both first-period teachers and the table set up in the atrium will be collecting donations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Any and all support is appreciated.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p class=first_paragraph&gt;
    The autumn leaves whirled A. around, whistling with the wind. The park was serene. Kids playing, adults laughing, and birds chirping. The autumn leaves were the cherry on top, painting the scene with the colours of a flickering fire. Although it signified the end of a warm season, the beauty the people got to see made up for the cold days ahead. Had the scene been painted, the artist surely would've noticed the warm centre of it all. A boy in grey, nervously chatting away with the girl laughing in the yellow raincoat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    To a stranger, Levi was a quiet, somewhat dull boy, who was the personification of grey. To his friends, Levi was shy, yet rich in personality. He was eccentric, smart, and funny, but simply too introverted to make a presence. To Amelia, he was perfect. The two fifteen-year-olds met at the beginning of high school, yet from their very first conversation, they immediately knew they had clicked. Although Amelia was more sociable, both of them appreciated quiet. Amelia's willingness to dive into a conversation allowed a wonderful friendship to blossom, until they realised they wanted to be more than just friends. Just a month into their friendship, they both embraced their mutual feelings, and they started dating. Levi awkwardly shuffled his feet across the foliage. Surveying the lively park, the sight of the familiar yellow raincoat caught his attention. Levi waved towards the figure, who hurried over at the sight of him.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Hey! Why'd you call me here? the girl puffed, slightly shaken from the run.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    N-nothing, Levi stammered. Just wanted your company, Amelia.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Amelia cheekily grinned, Two days and you already miss me?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Levi avoided her gaze, I guess.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    He sat down by the foot of a tree, where Amelia followed suit. The two sat close to one another in blissful silence for some time, appreciating each other's warmth in the cooling weather. Levi was so relaxed that he nearly jolted at the sudden weight that had fallen on his shoulder. He carefully turned to his right and saw that Amelia had fallen asleep. Levi smiled to himself. No matter how much time passed, part of him still couldn't believe they were actually dating. Levi gently snaked his arm around Amelia's shoulder and pulled her close. Levi was the happiest he had been all week, but even so, a small frown ruptured his gentle expression as a sense of guilt suddenly washed over him. The two of them were under this exact tree only a few weeks ago. It had been a beautiful day and just like today, Levi had singled out the big tree in the park as a nice spot for him and Amelia. The two had sat in silence. Only the wind was audible, the rest of the world was quiet. To the new couple, it was only the two  of them in the entire world.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    You know, Amelia had begun, giving him a meaningful look. This is a spot where a lot of couples have shared their first kiss.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    On the outside, Levi merely nodded. On the inside, he was freaking out. Of course, couples kiss under the beautiful hollywood-esque tree, just like in a fairytale. Time seemed to slow down, as Amelia slowly leaned forward.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    What am I supposed to do? Do I want to kiss her? Yes, I do, but I'm so nervous. What should I do? It'd be so awkward if I pulled away, and it's not like I don't want to, but I'm... just not ready.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Levi? Amelia's voice cut through the mess of anxiety that was Levi's current state of mind.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Y-yes?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Amelia looked down, her hair hiding her expression. It's alright, I'll wait until you're ready.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Part of him felt happy that Amelia respected Levi's personal space, and that she cared enough about him to. On the other hand, Levi felt that he wasn't showing that he cared enough about her.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    What kind of partner can't kiss the person they love? Levi murmured to himself, shaking his head.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    The once-calm wind began to pick up speed. The whistling transformed into wailing. Levi looked over at Amelia - still asleep. It must be cold for her, Levi thought. I'd hate for her to get a cold. Levi slid closer to Amelia, both arms around her. He awkwardly sat there, arms around his sleeping partner.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    I should've thought of what to do next because hugging her is doing nothing right now, Levi muttered to himself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Maybe if I- You're not doing nothing. Levi blinked, surprised.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    You're awake?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    She smiled. Never asleep.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    He grimaced processing all the things he did and mumbled. Hey, did you hear me-
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Yes. Amelia turned her head to face Levi, her expression flickering from playful to concerned.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Are you forcing yourself to hug me right now? Levi felt Amelia stiffen around his arms. In response, he hugged her a little tighter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    No, I'm hugging you because I want to. With those words, he felt her relax in his embrace.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    If that's the case, then that's all you have to do. Amelia said.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    What keeps making you feel bad?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Levi's immediate reaction was to deny any problems, but then Amelia's question sunk in. What am I afraid of? I'm not afraid of her, that's definitely not it. I... Before Levi began suffocating in his mind, Amelia tapped him on the shoulder, shaking him from his trance.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Just talk to me about what you're feeling, I don't care if it's a jumbled mess, I just want to hear it Levi began to wrack his brain.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    You know like when there's that fluttering feeling? He looked at her, slightly fearful that she would think he was insane. Amelia merely nodded encouragingly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    S-so it's like, not really fear but it's kind of jittery? A-And it makes me feel stiff. but I shouldn't feel this way, right? It feels like I'm doing something wrong...
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Levi's voice trailed oft avoiding her gaze. After a few awkward seconds, he risked a glance at his partner. Amelia smirked, clearly knowing far more about Levi than he knew about himself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    You're just nervous. There's nothing more complicated than that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    I-I know! Levi blurted, surprising Amelia.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    It's just... surely that can't be it? I'm not supposed to be nervous around you!
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    She smiled warmly. Levi... it's perfectly normal.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    He sighed, he knew that as well. I just don't want to be nervous around you anymore.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Amelia gestured to Levi's arms which were still wrapped around her. You're already doing pretty well in my opinion.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    The sun that once shone a bright yellow began to shine a pungent orange, with the sky following suit. The wind was calm once more. helping paint the sky with more colours of the leaves. The two sat in comfortable silence, admiring the scenery. The sleepy children whined to their parents. the birds chirped quieter, and the sun began to sink. Soon, it was just the two of them, basking in the comfortable moonlight. Amelia abruptly stood up, knocking Levi over.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Sorry! Amelia giggled, helping him up.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Levi smiled, As if you feel bad.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Amelia grinned in return. You know me so well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    The two walked in tandem, heading to their respective homes. Hey,- Amelia whispered. Levi turned towards her.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    What's up? If all that was about that almost kiss - when I told you I'll wait until you're ready, I meant it
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Levi blushed before grabbing Amelia's hand. Thank you.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    He looked down, hiding his smile. Guess I better get ready too,
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Amelia declared and gently nudged him. I'm hoping you mean that test because your grades need work,
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Levi scoffed. Harsh.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    The two laughed, filling the quiet park. Even as they quieted down, their happiness didn't falter. They both knew that autumn would give them more moments like this, for many years to come. At last, with the birds asleep, kids tucked into bed, and the moon hiding away the fiery colours with its cold light, the wind finally fell asleep, leaving the two lovers to their own devices, ready to start again the next day. Autumn is a charming season. It shows its flair by burning its trees with bright colours, while making music with its winds. Bringing people together with its music and fiery colours is what makes autumn such a charming season. Autumn doesn't discriminate, it'll bring everyone together with enough time. So, the two lovers needn't worry, for nobody can resist autumn's charm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/img&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;!--article body--&gt;
   &lt;p class=first_paragraph&gt;
    One  dull  evening,  Prince  Kyi  was inside the castle, in his room as a punishment for daringly filling one of the royal   servant’s   shoes   with thumbtacks. As the only child of the Great King Svelvin and Majestic Queen Yawinn, he was often up to no good; planting pranks and getting into huge amounts of trouble.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “I’m. So. Bored!” groaned Kyi, dangling upside down from his bunk bed. “Don’t you wanna get outta here and do something fun? I’d rather clean dragon poop in the stables than be here.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “No, Kyi, remember what Master said? ‘You cannot go anywhere because—’”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “‘I’m grounded for life until I can learn to act like a proper prince!’” mocked Kyi, in his best impression of his father. “I know, Boshi the Dorsegoat, you don’t have to remind me.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Boshi was Kyi’s pet and companion. The name ‘Dorsegoat’ alluded to the fact that Boshi was part goat, part dog, and part horse-- a very rare creature to encounter nowadays.   The two had been best friends since the day they met in Elgerwicker Woods.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    When Kyi stumbled upon such a peculiar creature with baby blue splotches all over its silver body, a long mane that flickered like fiery flames, and eyes of polished emerald, he could not just leave it be. He could not forget about the creature. So instead, they became a team. Boshi was the loyal one with an obedient spirit, while Kyi was… let’s just say he was the rascal of the duo.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Kyi was struck by an idea. And as you can imagine, it was a pretty naughty one.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “Boshi, what if we just stepped outside  for a bit to explore the castle garden?”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “Oh, here we go again,” sighed Boshi.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “No, listen, it’s the perfect plan! That way, we’ll be right outside my room and won’t be bored anymore!”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “As your BFF, I can’t stop you, but I will tell you that that’s a bad idea!”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Kyi frowned and put his hands on his hips. “Well, if you’re not gonna come with me, that’s fine. I’ll go enjoy those delicious,   crispy   Ghilji  leaves  all  bymyself,” he teased, knowing that the leaves were Boshi’s favourite food.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “You wouldn’t!” Boshi gasped.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “Oh yes, I would!” Kyi ran towards his room’s star-shaped window, swiftly pushed it open, and jumped straight out, head first.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    Boshi was appalled, his lips wide open, forming a perfect ‘O’. He rushed towards the ledge, a feeling of absolute dread in his stomach— only to find Kyi howling in laughter on top of a large bush.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “Kyi, are you okay?!” screeched Boshi from above. Kyi gave him a thumbs-up. With a quick jerk of Boshi’s small, triangular ears, some of the castle bricks wiggled and jiggled outwards, creating a spiral set of stairs for him to walk down. When he landed, the bricks returned to their natural places.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “You could’ve done that this whole time? Now my robes are all dirty.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “Not the point! Don’t you ever jump out a window like that again!”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “I can’t guarantee nothing,” chuckled Kyi, getting up and dusting himself off.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “I’m just glad you’re not hurt. Now, since I’m already down here, those Ghilji leaves aren’t going to eat themselves, are they?” They grinned at each other.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    The palace garden was a remarkable sight; fields of fresh, forest-green grass sprouted wildly, housing the most magnificent flowers you could imagine. Snow-white calla lilies, spotted ghost orchids, sunset-coloured lady slippers, and the occasional old man of the forest mushroom. Twinkling fireflies illuminated the cobblestone pathways, all humming an ancient song the gardeners claimed could help the flowers grow. In the distance were coral-coloured trees with large pearl orbs hanging from each branch, standing tall under the symphony of purple that was the sky.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “Wow… I wish Father would let me outta the castle more often,” Kyi murmured in awe.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p class=article&gt;
    “Technically, he didn’t let you out,” remarked Boshi. Kyi scoffed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/img&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
